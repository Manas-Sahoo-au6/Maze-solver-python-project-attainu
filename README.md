## Maze Solver
The Maze Solver is a program that takes input as an NxN matrix and outputs the path of the maze denoting 1 as path and 0 as block/wall.

### First step after opening Python Project.
___
Github Python Project consists of 3 contents.

- README.md

- MazeBt.exe

- MazeBt.py
***

## MazeBt.exe
### Install

```sh
 download MazeBt.exe and install it on your pc
```
___
## How to run MazeSolver exe file In Windows Operating System
___
First of All Download the `MazeBt.exe` File and install it,
. When you Install It the all file automatically extracted and Automatic generated a Folder Named as `MazeBt`.
. next Open The `MazeBt` Folder ,The Folder consists of -:
 - 1.input.txt (input example Matrix form)
 - 2.MazeBt.exe
 - 3.MaeBt.py
 - 4.RUN.bat (for window user only)
 - 5.RUNLINUX.sh (for linux user)

.Next Give the input maze in the n*n matrix form with binary digit input (1,0) and `notice: gap between each cell will be compulsory ` `a example matrix alredy given there as input.txt`
.next and final step double click the `RUN.bat` file it takes 2seconds to run and path.txt file generated automatically which consists of solved maze matrix with executed time and date and with movement direction from source to destination.


## How to run MazeSolver exe file In Linux Operating System
___
. Open the MazeBt folder from GitHub Repo
.Next Give the input maze in the n*n matrix form with binary digit input (1,0) and `notice: gap between each cell will be compulsory like 0,1,0,0,1` `a example matrix alredy given there as input.txt`
.next and final step double click the `RUNLINUX.sh `file it takes 2seconds to run and path.txt file generated automatically which consists of solved maze matrix with executed time and date and with movement direction from source to destination.

## My Approach to Solve the problem.
__
```
  My first approach is always to do this project by BFS \n
  because breadth-first search always gives the shortest path as the nature of its algorithm, But i spend lot times in reading articles and youtube but finally understand that for solving maze problem backtracking with 
  recursion is the best approach to solve this Maze solver
```

## Code Explanation (Step by Step).
___

step1-: first from the driver function through the arparse command line the input is taken which is given by the user `python MazeBt.py -i input.txt -o path.txt`.(line no 121 to line no 127)
-  step2: now the `input.txt` data from file will generated by a function and store the matrix data in an array `maze`(line no 130 to 133)
- step3:- now we take a solution matrix as like input maze but value should be 0.
- step4: now function `maze_runner` start solving maze using backtraking recursion by chceking `up down left right` value.
-  finnaly return the solution matrix only to the `print_function`.
-  `print_function` now call another one function that is extra feature of this project that is `printDirec` . this function check the movement of solution matrix ., it checks whether the `solvedMaze` whether the position cell one or zero , then return an string value if it `down up left right` movement.

- step5: last step is the appending all solvedMaze value in to the `File2` text file in string formate.
___
## Technology used in this Project.
***
- `argparse` - This is the python module for taking input in command line interface 
- `filesystem`(read,append,write)- with this function we read the input file, append and write the o/p string formate in the output path text File .
- `pyinstaller` used for converting the python file into exe file .
- `nsis ` software for making user friendly exe file for easy installation for users.

## - My Final Words.
___
Thanks to Instructor `Priyesh srivastav `for guiding us to do this Project.
